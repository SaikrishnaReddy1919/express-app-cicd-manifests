## What this does?

This repo along with https://github.com/SaikrishnaReddy1919/simple-express-app-cicd creates a Jenkins pipeline with GitOps to deploy code into a Kubernetes cluster. CI part is done via Jenkins and CD part via ArgoCD (GitOps).

Please refer to the https://github.com/SaikrishnaReddy1919/simple-express-app-cicd/blob/main/README.md for the instructions on how to use the codes.

Any doubts implementing this? Reach out to me at my mail on my profile.
